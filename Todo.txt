Mark's To do list

################################


Milestones:
	Second - Playable one map multiplayer
		Networking
		Basic game mechanics done, can play the game
		Should be fun at this point!
	Third - Feature complete
		All weapons, powerups implemented
		Map switching


_______________________________________________________________________________

Code:


Character
	Create placeholder sprite
	Firing
		Flame placeholder image
	Aiming
		Camera follows cursor a bit?

cracked tiles?
respawning tiles?
	respawning tiles - 10-15 sec
			small graphic in middle when half way through respawn time

Networking
	test disconnects and playing offline
	synchronize player movements




Wishlist:
Improve wall collisions
Joystick/Gamepad control
Test on Windows/Linux
Custom mouse cursor(s)
Add fade out and draw fn to Emitter to make it more useful
Factor GameObject static methods into GameObjectManager
	Make creation and deletion process more robust
	Try to eliminate modification while iterating
Better Map Editor
	In-game editor? Tiled? Image file?



Thoughts about networking (won't be coded for a while):
Network module
	Objects can send updates to the Network
		Network sends updates to the server 
		Can possibly combine multiple updates to make messages smaller
	Network holds on to revieved messages until asked to run them
	Game tells Network to run all updates
		How to determine recieving object? Publish/subscribe?
			E.g. Player 4 object subscribes to "p04" network messages
Server
	Server forwards updates from each player to all other players
		Ignore messages that contradict current map state
	Stores
		Persistent: Player names/Scores
		In game: time left, list of destroyed tiles (for observers)
		Voting: map suggestions, recent maps, num votes
	Hosting
		Run the server program seperately
			Prints out the IP and port
		Players join the host by IP
	Game flow
		Vote map
			Server chooses a selection of maps based on num players
			Players vote on a map by moving onto 3 voting areas
			Displays a thumbnail, name, and number of votes
			Chooses the one with the most votes when timer runs out
		Server starts the chosen map
		Game over
			Game is over when condition is met (e.g. 100 points or 1 survivor)
			Also a clock to prevent stalemates
		Server starts voting map
Updates
	Each client owns their Player (and maybe some bots)
		Owned players - can heat tiles, pick up stuff, die, respawn
		Unowned players - run around and look pretty
	Projectiles and the like are also owned
		Owned projectiles - can change a tile's state
		Unowned projectiles - look pretty, can hit the owned players
	Tiles are not owned
		When a player heats a tile up to a multiple of 5, update the server
		If you heat it up to the last level, mark it as owned
			When an owned tile dies, tell the server
			When tile respawns, tell the server again, then release ownership
	Chat
		Client sends strings to server
	Menu options
		Vote to end round - only living players count
		Exit game


Sendng objects vs sending data
	Size vs processing
	Sending objects
		recieve a stream of objects
		send them to subscribers based on their types
	Sending data
		recieve a stream of data
		turn data into objects based on a protocol
		then do the same thing
		how to reminder:
			dataoutput(bufferedoutput(os))
				dataoutput.write, buf.flush()
			datainput(is)

Art:

Have people replace the placeholders
	Character left,right,up,down
	Map - tileset & background


_______________________________________________________________________________

Audio:

Get a couple background music's
Sound effects
	Flamethrower loop
	Fall
	Jump

Design:

What are the "core pillars" of our game?
Define the theme better
Game name?

Differentiate from Spleef
	Pizza Spleef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_39RxKj0pk
	Need to differentiate, don't want a clone for 2 reasons:
		1. We don't want to make a clone of any game
		2. 2D Spleef probably wouldn't be that good 
	Our version could be more tactical:
		Takes a second or two to light an area on fire, isn't instantaneous
		Players have a chance to run away from people trying to burn them
		To kill people you have to think tactically - 
			Set up traps, fight for space, maneuver around danger

Game type
	Could have different modes:
		Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch
		Find the ball and hold it, Capture the flag

Flamethrower
	More or less powerful?
		Balance with more or less heat generated when using

Weapons
	Should we have them?
	Do you have one Flamethrower and one Alt weapon, or can you cycle through
	Limited ammo? Durability?
	Do you select them or pick them up?
	Ideas:
		(Should be awesome and cool thematically)
		Bow and arrow - slow while charging, knocks enemy back
			Flaming arrows?
		Sword/bat - melee weapon that knocks back
		Traps - Lay slow traps or bomb traps
		Grenade - sets all tiles in an area on fire
		Place plank - replace missing plank or place a new plank on burning one
		Hose / water baloon

Powerups
	Temporary or permanent?
	Increase Flamethrower range/power/heat capacity
	Increase speed, jetpack
	Copied from PizzaSpleef:
		Blind other players, stealth
