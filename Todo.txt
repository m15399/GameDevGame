Mark's To do list

################################


Milestones:
	Second - Playable one map multiplayer
		Networking
		Basic game mechanics done, can play the game
		Should be fun at this point!
	Third - Feature complete
		All weapons, powerups implemented
		Map switching


Amazon Server: 54.153.119.226:8000

_______________________________________________________________________________

Code:

Milestone 2 features:
	Melee and ranged - pickup, use, respawn
	Bigger map


Weapons
	Server tells you when you picked up a weapon, when you get hit
	Bow and arrow weapon
		sync
	Sword
		sync
	weapon info - 1 byte?
		type - 4 bits, charge amount/state - 4 bits 




Improve Networking:

	Switch to UDP

	Server keeps track of names
		name set message
			n, pNum name, pNum name...
		look up name by player number in player manager
			playerManager.getName(int pNum) - null or name
		When server gets greeting
			send NameSetMessage(new pnum, new pname) to all clients
		At the start of each round need to send greetings to server again
			should already be happening in GameDevGame
			make sure no players joining concurrently
			make players stand still for 3 sec so we don't have to send whole state

	Join game menu displays error if unable to connect
		join menu connects Client to test it, doesn't start game
		get the player number in menu before gamedev game
		start the GameDevGame
		GDG sends player name indicating ready for game data
		GreetingMessage
			name

Improve sound:
	Be able to play multiple copies of sound effect
	Run in another thread to prevent skips
	Set fx volume based on location


Sources of complexity:
Object creation, destruction, updating workings unclear
	onStart is called at the start of the next frame...
Network messages 
	Still have to add to DataTranslator's list
	Multiple subscribers/unsubscribing?
	Recieving at wrong time
		If no subscribers, store until someone subscribes


Misc Features:
In game menu - dc, etc
Settings menu - front and in game


Wishlist:
Improve wall collisions
Joystick/Gamepad control
Test on Windows/Linux
Custom mouse cursor(s)
Add fade out and draw fn to Emitter to make it more useful
Factor GameObject static methods into GameObjectManager
	Make creation and deletion process more robust
	Try to eliminate modification while iterating
Better Map Editor
	In-game editor? Tiled? Image file?
More useful server logs
Single player
	Bots
	Tutorial mission
	Coop missions? Enemies? How do you fight them?
Use timer instead of frameNumber % 15 in Map.java
Testing
	Test with simulated lag
	Test with simulated low framerate
	Test very large maps
	Pasting on other OS's
Cache enum.values()
Cache "new font" fonts
Make server program more command line friendly - help, specify port
Camera follows cursor a bit?
Reduce players ability to cheat
	Move more responsibility to server - dying, respawning
	Server checks what the player is doing and whether it's legal
		e.g. can't go from falling state to not falling state
Support mp3s
Music system
Refactor player - PlayerMovement, PlayerController, etc
Server handles all collisions
Always draw player names on top
Split game into more packages



Thoughts about networking (won't be coded for a while):
Server
	Server forwards updates from each player to all other players
		Ignore messages that contradict current map state
	Stores
		Persistent: Player names/Scores
		In game: time left, list of destroyed tiles (for observers)
		Voting: map suggestions, recent maps, num votes
	Game flow
		Vote map
			Server chooses a selection of maps based on num players
			Players vote on a map by moving onto 3 voting areas
			Displays a thumbnail, name, and number of votes
			Chooses the one with the most votes when timer runs out
		Server starts the chosen map
		Game over
			Game is over when condition is met (e.g. 100 points or 1 survivor)
			Also a clock to prevent stalemates
		Server starts voting map
Updates
	Projectiles and the like are also owned
		Owned projectiles - can change a tile's state
		Unowned projectiles - look pretty, can hit the owned players
	Menu options
		Vote to end round - only living players count
		Exit game
Map switching
	destroy everything when SwitchMapMessage recieved
		create a new GameDevGame
	remember to unsubscribe everything when destroyed
	GameDevGame recreates everything, which subscribes again

Art:

Have people replace the placeholders
	Character left,right,up,down
	Map - tileset & background


_______________________________________________________________________________

Audio:

Get a couple background music's
Sound effects
	Flamethrower loop
	Fall
	Jump

Design:

What are the "core pillars" of our game?
Define the theme better
Game name?

Differentiate from Spleef
	Pizza Spleef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_39RxKj0pk
	Need to differentiate, don't want a clone for 2 reasons:
		1. We don't want to make a clone of any game
		2. 2D Spleef probably wouldn't be that good 
	Our version could be more tactical:
		Takes a second or two to light an area on fire, isn't instantaneous
		Players have a chance to run away from people trying to burn them
		To kill people you have to think tactically - 
			Set up traps, fight for space, maneuver around danger

Game type
	Could have different modes:
		Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch
		Find the ball and hold it, Capture the flag

Flamethrower
	More or less powerful?
		Balance with more or less heat generated when using

Weapons
	Should we have them?
	Do you have one Flamethrower and one Alt weapon, or can you cycle through
	Limited ammo? Durability?
	Do you select them or pick them up?
	Ideas:
		(Should be awesome and cool thematically)
		Bow and arrow - slow while charging, knocks enemy back
			Flaming arrows?
		Sword/bat - melee weapon that knocks back
		Traps - Lay slow traps or bomb traps
		Grenade - sets all tiles in an area on fire
		Place plank - replace missing plank or place a new plank on burning one
		Hose / water baloon

Powerups
	Temporary or permanent?
	Increase Flamethrower range/power/heat capacity
	Increase speed, jetpack
	Copied from PizzaSpleef:
		Blind other players, stealth
