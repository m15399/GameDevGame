Mark's To do list

################################


Milestones:
	First - Player and Level:
		Walking around, bumping into walls, falling through pits and dying
		Flamethrower
		Burning floor
	Second - Playable with Bots:
		Simple AI
		Basic game mechanics done, can play the game
		Should be fun at this point!
	Third - Playable with Friends:
		Get multiplayer working

_______________________________________________________________________________

Code:


Character
	Create placeholder sprite
	Firing
		Flame placeholder image
	Aiming
		Camera follows cursor a bit?

cracked tiles?
respawning tiles?
	respawning tiles - 10-15 sec
			small graphic in middle when half way through respawn time



Wishlist:
Mouse breaks when resizing?
Improve wall collisions
Joystick/Gamepad control
Test on Windows/Linux
Hitting space .25 seconds before you hit the ground should still jump
Custom mouse cursor(s)
Add fade out and draw fn to Emitter to make it more useful
Factor GameObject static methods into GameObjectManager


Thoughts about networking (won't be coded for a while):
Network module
	Objects can send updates to the Network
		Network sends updates to the server 
		Can possibly combine multiple updates to make messages smaller
	Network holds on to revieved messages until asked to run them
	Game tells Network to run all updates
		How to determine recieving object? Publish/subscribe?
			E.g. Player 4 object subscribes to "p04" network messages
Server
	Server forwards updates from each player to all other players
	Global stuff like score, time left, map suggestions, starting the game
	Hosting
		Run the server program seperately
			Prints out the IP and port
		Players join the host by IP
	Game flow
		Server chooses a selection of maps based on num players
		Players vote on a map (maybe they vote by moving around on a wait map?)
		Server starts the map
		Game over
			Game is over when condition is met (e.g. 100 points or 1 survivor)
			Also a clock to prevent stalemates
Updates
	Each client owns their Player (and maybe some bots)
		Owned players - can heat tiles, pick up stuff, die, respawn
		Unowned players - run around and look pretty
	Projectiles and the like are also owned
		Owned projectiles - can change a tile's state
		Unowned projectiles - look pretty, can hit the owned players
	Tiles are not owned
		When a player heats a tile up enough to change its stage
			The tile changes states and updates the server
	Chat
		Client sends strings to server
	Menu options
		Vote to end round - only living players count
		Exit game

Get a couple background music's

Design:

What are the "core pillars" of our game?
Define the theme better

Differentiate from Spleef
	Pizza Spleef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_39RxKj0pk
	Need to differentiate, don't want a clone for 2 reasons:
		1. We don't want to make a clone of any game
		2. 2D Spleef probably wouldn't be that good 
	Our version could be more tactical:
		Takes a second or two to light an area on fire, isn't instantaneous
		Players have a chance to run away from people trying to burn them
		To kill people you have to think tactically - 
			Set up traps, fight for space, maneuver around danger

Game type
	Could have different modes:
		Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch
		Find the ball and hold it, Capture the flag

Flamethrower
	More or less powerful?
		Balance with more or less heat generated when using

Weapons
	Should we have them?
	Do you have one Flamethrower and one Alt weapon, or can you cycle through
	Limited ammo? Durability?
	Do you select them or pick them up?
	Ideas:
		(Should be awesome and cool thematically)
		Bow and arrow - slow while charging, knocks enemy back
			Flaming arrows?
		Sword/bat - melee weapon that knocks back
		Traps - Lay slow traps or bomb traps
		Grenade - sets all tiles in an area on fire
		Place plank - replace missing plank or place a new plank on burning one
		Hose / water baloon

Powerups
	Temporary or permanent?
	Increase Flamethrower range/power/heat capacity
	Increase speed, jetpack
	Copied from PizzaSpleef:
		Blind other players, stealth
