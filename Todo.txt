Mark's To do list

################################


Milestones:
	Second - Playable one map multiplayer
		Networking
		Basic game mechanics done, can play the game
		Should be fun at this point!
	Third - Feature complete
		All weapons, powerups implemented
		Map switching


_______________________________________________________________________________

Code:

2nd Milestone Features:
	Respawning tiles
	Bow and arrow weapon
	Scoreboard (deaths per minute or something)
	Basic menu for join game, play offline
		Type name, address/port, join game
	Running on Amazon server



Character
	Create placeholder sprite
	Firing
		Flame placeholder image
	Aiming
		Camera follows cursor a bit?

respawning tiles
	respawning tiles - 10-15 sec
			small graphic in middle when half way through respawn time

Networking
	players
		weapon info - 1 byte?
			type - 4 bits, charge amount/state - 4 bits 

	map - runs on server
		steps:
			4. Server sends full map state to joining players
				be careful about joining player recieving messages before
				the intro message with whole map
		updates
			server is authoritative - decides what happens
				handle all race conditions with rules
					if two updates have diff temps, favor hotter one
			client
				updates
					if local player changed a tile's state (empty/wood)
						1. send update:
							tx ty state/heat
							byte byte 2/6-bits
		joining observers
			send whole map state
			filename... state/heat bytes
			can send whole map without causing lag?

	space = 20
	10 player updates/sec = 200 bytes/sec = .2 kB/s
	4 map updates/sec = 10 bytes/sec * 16 players = 160 bytes/sec = .16 kB/sec
	want < ? kB/sec for each player and server



Wishlist:
Improve wall collisions
Joystick/Gamepad control
Test on Windows/Linux
Custom mouse cursor(s)
Add fade out and draw fn to Emitter to make it more useful
Factor GameObject static methods into GameObjectManager
	Make creation and deletion process more robust
	Try to eliminate modification while iterating
Better Map Editor
	In-game editor? Tiled? Image file?
More useful server logs
	Able to close windows without quitting
	Able to have fatal errors without closing console
Single player
	Tutorial mission
	Coop missions? 
		Enemies? How do you fight them?
Set buffered stream size so we don't cut messages
Use timer instead of frameNumber % 15 in Map.java
Test with simulated lag
Test with simulated low framerate
Test very large maps
Cache enum.values()



Thoughts about networking (won't be coded for a while):
Server
	Server forwards updates from each player to all other players
		Ignore messages that contradict current map state
	Stores
		Persistent: Player names/Scores
		In game: time left, list of destroyed tiles (for observers)
		Voting: map suggestions, recent maps, num votes
	Hosting
		Run the server program seperately
			Prints out the IP and port
		Players join the host by IP
	Game flow
		Vote map
			Server chooses a selection of maps based on num players
			Players vote on a map by moving onto 3 voting areas
			Displays a thumbnail, name, and number of votes
			Chooses the one with the most votes when timer runs out
		Server starts the chosen map
		Game over
			Game is over when condition is met (e.g. 100 points or 1 survivor)
			Also a clock to prevent stalemates
		Server starts voting map
Updates
	Each client owns their Player (and maybe some bots)
		Owned players - can heat tiles, pick up stuff, die, respawn
		Unowned players - run around and look pretty
	Projectiles and the like are also owned
		Owned projectiles - can change a tile's state
		Unowned projectiles - look pretty, can hit the owned players
	Tiles are not owned
		When a player heats a tile up to a multiple of 5, update the server
		If you heat it up to the last level, mark it as owned
			When an owned tile dies, tell the server
			When tile respawns, tell the server again, then release ownership
	Chat
		Client sends strings to server
	Menu options
		Vote to end round - only living players count
		Exit game
Map switching
	destroy everything but GameDevGame
		destroy everything but tag?
	remember to unsubscribe everything when destroyed
	GameDevGame recreates everything, which subscribes again

Art:

Have people replace the placeholders
	Character left,right,up,down
	Map - tileset & background

Audio:

Get a couple background music's
Sound effects
	Flamethrower loop
	Fall
	Jump

Design:

What are the "core pillars" of our game?
Define the theme better
Game name?

Differentiate from Spleef
	Pizza Spleef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_39RxKj0pk
	Need to differentiate, don't want a clone for 2 reasons:
		1. We don't want to make a clone of any game
		2. 2D Spleef probably wouldn't be that good 
	Our version could be more tactical:
		Takes a second or two to light an area on fire, isn't instantaneous
		Players have a chance to run away from people trying to burn them
		To kill people you have to think tactically - 
			Set up traps, fight for space, maneuver around danger

Game type
	Could have different modes:
		Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch
		Find the ball and hold it, Capture the flag

Flamethrower
	More or less powerful?
		Balance with more or less heat generated when using

Weapons
	Should we have them?
	Do you have one Flamethrower and one Alt weapon, or can you cycle through
	Limited ammo? Durability?
	Do you select them or pick them up?
	Ideas:
		(Should be awesome and cool thematically)
		Bow and arrow - slow while charging, knocks enemy back
			Flaming arrows?
		Sword/bat - melee weapon that knocks back
		Traps - Lay slow traps or bomb traps
		Grenade - sets all tiles in an area on fire
		Place plank - replace missing plank or place a new plank on burning one
		Hose / water baloon

Powerups
	Temporary or permanent?
	Increase Flamethrower range/power/heat capacity
	Increase speed, jetpack
	Copied from PizzaSpleef:
		Blind other players, stealth
