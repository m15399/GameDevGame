# How to run:

To run the Game, run game.GameDevGame.java. You can then connect to a server, or run the game offline if you just want to test gameplay features. 

To start a Server, run server.Server.java. This will start a server on your computer on port 8000. Then you can connect to it at localhost:8000.
